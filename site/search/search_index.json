You'll like it because... It's Affordable JetBot costs less than $250 in parts, including Jetson Nano. The DIY kit includes a bill of materials which you must purchase and a 3D printed chassis that you can print, or order. If you're looking to get up and running as quick as possible, there are also many third party kits available that come pre-bundled. It's Educational JetBot includes a set of Notebooks which cover basic robotics concepts like programatic motor control, to more advanced topics like training a custom AI for avoiding collisions. What you'll learn isn't limited to JetBot. You'll learn concepts related to neural network data collection and training that extend as far as your imagination. It's Easy to Setup JetBot is programmed from your web browser. Just connect your JetBot to Wifi and launch the JetBot Docker Container . This enables JetBot's web programming environment, which is available even after the JetBot reboots. Once your JetBot boots, just type it's IP address into your web browser and start programming. It's Fun! We built JetBot to make exploring ideas related to robotics as fun as possible. In effect, it's a portable, battery powered AI computer with a camera that's super easy to program. This makes it the perfect platform for trying new ideas related to AI, image processing and robotics. Our experiments have led us to new projects like JetRacer , and we're excited to see where your experiments take you. Get Started To get started with JetBot, follow the Getting Started instructions. If you run into any issues along the way, please let us know ! Go to GitHub Get Started Get involved We really appreciate any feedback related to JetBot, and also just enjoy seeing what you're working on! There is a growing community of Jetson Nano and JetBot users. It's easy to get involved involved...

It is offset by 1-pin from the corner. Step 4 - Strip motor driver power cable Select the depicted micro USB from the pack Pay careful attention to the image. The cables are not identical. The other micro USB cable will be used to power the Jetson Nano. Using the wrong power cable for Nano will block it's Ethernet port. Cut the depicted cable roughly ~20cm from the type-A terminal Strip the rubber coating ~3cm from the cut Remove the green / white wires and metal shielding. Strip the red and black wires about ~5mm from cut (optional) Twist the exposed strand wire and coat with solder Step 5 - Mount motor driver Route the spliced cable through chassis Secure exposed red (+) and black (-) wires to the power terminals on motor driver > Pay attention to the markings on the motor driver. Incorrect wiring could damage the driver. Route the spliced cable under the motor driver to organize and prevent stress on screw terminal Secure motor driver to chassis using self taping screws Secure left and right motor wires to motor screw terminals > Notice (3/11/2019): We made a slight mistake: the red and black wires for the left and right motor are actually flipped in the image shown above. This will not cause damage, but the motors will spin backwards. Please flip them to the correct orientation. Step 6 - Mount WiFi antennas Secure one patch antenna to the underside of top plate Secure the other patch antenna at edge of battery bay Route connectors as shown Step 7 - Remove Jetson Nano module from developer kit Remove standoff screws from Jetson Nano module Release the side latches of SODIMM connector using hands Slide Jetson Nano module out of SODIMM connector Step 8 - Attach WiFi module to developer kit Attach developer kit to chassis using self taping screws Snap antennae on to WiFi module using fingers Remove the screw from developer kit by the M.2 socket Insert WiFi module into M.2 slot on developer kit Fasten WiFi module to developer kit with screw removed in (3) Re-attach the Jetson Nano module to developer kit Step 9 - Mount ball caster Place the caster ball inside of shroud Insert the caster base into shroud, securing the ball > If the socket is too tight, file it some. Attach the assembled caster onto the chassis with self taping screws > It will share two screw holes with the motor driver. Step 10 - Solder header onto PiOLED display Secure the 6-pin right angle header to PiOLED display by some method Solder the pins depicted (3.3V, SDA, SCL, and GND solder seen when zoomed in on right image) > The pins are close to the display screen, be careful to avoid the screen with soldering iron tip. Step 11 - Wire motor driver to PiOLED display Select 4 wire segment of female-female jumper cables. > We use brown, red, orange, yellow segment. You can map the colors accordingly. Attach 3.3V (red), GND (brown), SDA (orange), and SCL (yellow) to motor driver as shown Route the 4 wire jumper cable segment through chassis Attach red, brown, orange and yellow wires to right angle header as depicted Pay close attention! Reversing the red / brown wires could damage the system. Step 12 - Mount camera Attach the camera to the camera mount using 4x self tapping screws Attach the camera mount to chassis with 4x self tapping screws Insert the other end of ribbon cable into Jetson Nano developer kit (optional) Tuck the ribbon cable against heat sink to organize Step 13 - Attach wide angle sensor Peel off the original camera sensor Remove any excess adhesive material Remove the adhesive film cover from wide angle replacement sensor Attach wide angle replacement sensor to camera module Ensure the sensor connector is fastened to camera module Step 14 - Mount battery Attach double sided adhesive tabs to each end of battery, leaving some tab exposed Holding robot upside down, slide battery into battery bay Holding the battery in place, flip the robot and secure battery to chassis Step 15 - Organize wires Route USB cables through chassis to organize and prevent dragging Finished JetBot Once finished, your JetBot should look similar to this.","title":"Hardware Setup"},{"location":"hardware_setup.html#tools-needed","text":"To build JetBot you'll need the following tools Pliers Wire flush cutters/wire stripper Phillips screwdriver (+ Hex screwdriver for M2 hex socket screws ) Soldering iron and solder (optional) Precision Electronics Tweezers","title":"Tools needed"},{"location":"hardware_setup.html#assembly","text":"","title":"Assembly"},{"location":"hardware_setup.html#step-1-clean-3d-printed-parts","text":"Remove support material from motor sockets using pliers Remove support material from all surfaces, openings and screw holes using pliers, tweezers, and/or fingernails File material from openings if they are too tight","title":"Step 1 - Clean 3D printed parts"},{"location":"hardware_setup.html#step-2-mount-motors","text":"Cut and remove the zip tie from each motor Tuck the wires beneath transparent band to prevent stress on solder joints Insert each motor into the 3D printed chassis Secure each motor with 2x M3x25mm screws","title":"Step 2 - Mount motors"},{"location":"hardware_setup.html#step-3-solder-motor-driver","text":"Break away 3-pin and 2-pin male headers from header link that comes with motor driver package Join two of the screw terminal blocks to create a 4-pin screw terminal Solder the 2-pin and 4-pin screw terminals to motor driver Solder the 2-pin and 3-pin male headers to motor driver Pay careful attention to the position of the 3-pin header.

Insert an SD card into your desktop machine Using Etcher , select the jetbot_image_v0p4p0.zip image and flash it onto the SD card Remove the SD card from your desktop machine Step 2 - Boot Jetson Nano Insert the SD card into your Jetson Nano (the micro SD card slot is located under the module) Connect the monitor, keyboard, and mouse to the Nano Power on the Jetson Nano by connecting the micro USB charger to the micro USB port Important! We recommend first booting the Jetson Nano once without the piOLED / motor driver connected. This way you can check to make sure the system boots properly from the SD card image without worrying about hardware issues. After you've verified that it boots, reconnect the piOLED, double check your wiring, and boot again. Step 3 - Connect JetBot to WiFi Log in using the user jetbot and password jetbot Connect to a WiFi network using the Ubuntu desktop GUI Your Jetson Nano should now automatically connect to the WiFi at boot and display it's IP address on the piOLED display. Step 4 - Connect to JetBot from web browser After your robot is connected to WiFi, you can connect to the robot from a web browser by performing the following steps Shutdown JetBot using the Ubuntu GUI Unplug your HDMI monitor, USB keyboard, mouse and power supply from Jetson Nano Power the JetBot from the USB battery pack by plugging in the micro-USB cable Wait a bit for JetBot to boot Check the IP address of your robot on the piOLED display screen.
